        If you've stumbled here somehow, welcome! Fret not, we will grow. But
        for now, before adding a bunch of flashy useless things, feel free to
        check the <a href="/blog">point</a> of Speedrun.

      <h2>Our <span class="mv">mission</span></h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever needed to learn something really fast â€“ like, for
        yesterday if possible? We're here to help with that. The basic idea is:
        why would you need tons of text to understand a basic concept? We'll
        dumb it down, translate it to English, and teach you stuff in a couple
        of minutes.<br /> After you learn it and get the idea of what's going on,
        then we'll probably drop a wall of text to polish that knowledge. Maybe not,
        it kinda depends on the topic.
      </p>

      <h2>Our <span class="mv">vision</span></h2>
      <p>
        One day, we will help everyone learn coding in just a couple of weeks!
        The idea of "join this course and in a month you'll get ___ salary" will
        actually become a reality. <br /> How? <br /> By writing code. Not just a
        little code, but by writing a bunch of codes, and by not following the usual
        route. Stay tuned...
